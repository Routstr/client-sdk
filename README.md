# client-sdk

optional smart client sdk

instead of directly using endpoints over exsisting clients like `openai` we provide a smart client that will automatically handle things like
- cashu token cycling
- proxy or tor routing for privacy
- load balancing across providers
- auto selecting the best and cheapest
-
